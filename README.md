## Installation

1. You need to have node.js preinstalled
2. Run npm install
3. Run gulp serve to start development build process

## Requirements

1. Make it responsive by your best judgement.
2. The site should be retina compatible.
3. Do not use any image, everything should be made using CSS3. The only images
allowed are logos or photos.
4. The header should be stick to the top of the viewport. We recommend you to
use [Slick.js](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) for any carousel on the page.
If you want to use another library because you think it's better you have to
explain us why :)

At Codeiner we love the [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/).
It helps to increase code reliability and reusable components. If you haven't
heard anything about BEM we strongly recommend you to dig more about it. This
test it's a great opportunity for giving it a try!

We'd like to see you using Stylus/SASS/LESS for the CSS, show us your magic :)
